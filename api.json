      "full": "The Hugag is an enormous moose-like creature with a fatal design flaw: its legs are completely stiff and jointless. Unable to bend its legs at any joint, the Hugag cannot lie down to sleep. Instead, it must lean against large trees for support, dozing while standing upright. This vulnerability makes the otherwise formidable creature easy prey for clever lumberjacks. According to the tall tales, hunters simply find a sleeping Hugag, saw through the tree it's leaning against, and when the tree falls, the Hugag topples over. Unable to get back up with its rigid legs, the creature is helpless."
