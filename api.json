      "summary": "An enormous moose-like creature with stiff, jointless legs that cannot bend, forcing it to sleep leaning against trees; can be killed by sawing through the supporting tree.",
      "full": "The Hugag is a fearsome critter resembling an enormous moose but with one critical flaw: its legs are completely stiff and jointless, unable to bend at all. Because it cannot lie down, the Hugag must sleep standing upright, leaning against a tree for support. This vulnerability makes the creature easy prey for clever lumberjacks, who simply saw through the supporting tree. When the tree falls, the Hugag topples over and cannot get back up. According to the tall tales, this is how lumberjacks deal with the otherwise formidable creature. The Hugag represents the fearsome critter tradition's love of absurd biological flaws that create equally absurd hunting methods."
